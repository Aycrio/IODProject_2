# [Exploring Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Patterns, Trends & Modelling] (https://github.com/Aycrio/IODProject_2/tree/main)

This project delves into exploring greenhouse gas emission (GHG) trends and patterns from 1990 to 2020. 

The dataset is obtained from Climate Watch. 2022. Washington, DC: World Resources Institute. 
Available online at: https://www.climatewatchdata.org.

Through extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) I aim to uncover insights in the following areas:

* Geographic Analysis: Which countries contribute the most to GHG emission
* Industry Analysis: Which industries contribute the most to GHG emission
* Sector Analysis: Which sectors contribute the most to GHG emission
* Correlation Analysis: Does GDP, countries' capita, NDC Partnership have any effect on GHG emission 
*   Use of Logistic Regression and Naive Bayesian model to identify countries that achieved reduced GHG while maintaining economic growth
* Case study - How does Singapore's GHG emissions compare to its climate goals under the NDC partnership?
*   Using Machine Learning models such as Linear Regression and RandomForestRegression to predict future GHG emission
